These symptoms are\nusually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but\ndonâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about\n80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.\nAround 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously\nill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with\nunderlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems\nor diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
